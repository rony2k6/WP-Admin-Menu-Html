# wp_admin-menu_html
Admin Menu html extracted from wordpress

Wordpress Admin Menu is one of the most User Friendly Admin Menu (it's my opinion not sure about others).
I've searched for the Wordpress Admin Menu html to use in one of my project. But I've not found any. So, I decided to extract that menu from Wordpress.
Here goes the files:
  1) index.html
  2) css/admin-menu.css
  3) css/dashicons.css
  4) css/common.css (optional)
  5) js/common.js
  
If you are good in html/css/js, then it'll be easy for you to use in anywhere you want. Otherwise use this template to build more.

Thank you
